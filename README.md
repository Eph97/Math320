# Math320

This repository contains a collection of lecture notes for Yale's measure theory and integration class (Math 320).

These lecture notes will be collected throughout the semester by Ephraim Sutherland and Joshua Park.

The notes pdf is not tracked. To access, simply compile the notes.tex file. However, note we are using a custom formatting which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Eph97/coursework-latex)


A compiled pdf of the latest lecture notes can be downloaded through latest releases or by following [this link](https://github.com/Eph97/releases/latest/download/notes.pdf)
