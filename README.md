# MATH 320

This repository contains a collection of lecture notes for Yale's measure theory and integration class (MATH 320) during the Fall 2022 semester.

These lecture notes will be collected throughout the semester by Ephraim Sutherland and Joshua Park.

The notes pdf is not tracked but is updated periodically through releases. To compile locally, compile the notes.tex file. However we are using a custom formatting which must also be installed. Details on installing our custom style can be accessed [here](https://github.com/joshtreepark/coursework-latex)

A compiled pdf of the latest lecture notes can be downloaded through the "Compiled Notes" releases or by following this link to the [Compiled Notes](https://github.com/Eph97/Math320/releases/latest/download/notes.pdf)
