\begin{theorem}
	Riesz $ \Lambda : C_c (X) \to \mathbb{R}$ positive linear on nice space $X$ then $\Lambda(f) = \int f dm$ for a unique borel measure on $X$.
\end{theorem}

We have tools for constructing measure. Namely, the Caratheodory theorem for outer measure: Every outer measure is a positive measure on its Caratheodory sets.

Now we have two candidates for Lebesgue measure.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Lambda (f) = \underset{Riemann}{\int f}$
		Which should be given by: $\Lambda(f) = \int f dL$
	\item The outer Lebesgue measure  $l^* (A) = \inf\{\sum_K |Q_k| : A \subseteq \bigcup_{K} Q_k \}$ Should be $L$ on its Caratheodory sets.
\end{enumerate}

These are essentially the same.

\begin{lemma}
	$L^*$ is an outer measure on $\mathcal{P}(R^d)$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	$L^* (\emptyset)= 0$ because any collection of closed rectangles covers  $\emptyset$
\end{proof}
