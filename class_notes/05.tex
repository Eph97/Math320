Last time: positive measure spaces $(X, S, m)$. $X$ is a set, $S$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$ in (countably additive) positive measure in $S$. 

Today: Integration on $(X, S, m)$. 

Idea: approximate measurable $f : X \to [0, \infty]$ with simple functions. 

\begin{definition}
	A simple function is a measurable function $g : X \to [0, \infty)$ that takes only finitely many values. 
\end{definition}

If $g$ is simple, then there are reals $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in [0, \infty)$, and $A_n \in S$ such that 
\[
	g(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{k} \alpha_k \1 .
\]
