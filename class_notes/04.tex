Last Time: Basic results for measurable spaces $(X, S)$.

\begin{theorem}
  There is a $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(c)$ containing any collection $C$ of subsets of a set $X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
	If $(X,S_x), (Y,S_y)$ are measurable spaces, $f: X \to Y$ is $(S_x, S_y)$ measurable, $S_x \supseteq S_y$ and $S_y\supseteq S_y$, then $f$ is $(S_x, S_y)$ measurable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
  If $(X, S)$ is a measurable space and $f: X \to Y$, then 
	\[
		f^*(s) = \left\{A \supseteq Y \mid f^{-1}(A) \in S \right\}.
	\]
\end{theorem}
